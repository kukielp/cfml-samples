In this folder there should be at least two jar files:

- lucee-version.jar [download](https://download.lucee.org/)

- foundeo-fuseless-version.jar [download](https://github.com/foundeo/fuseless/releases/latest)

You can run the `init.sh` script if you are on mac or linux and it will download the jars for you. 

You can add additional jars and they will be automatically added to the distribution. Or better yet modify the `../build.gradle` file to add your dependencies.
